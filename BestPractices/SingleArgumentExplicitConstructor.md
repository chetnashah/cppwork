**1. Should I *always* use `explicit` constructors in C++?**

**General Rule/Strong Recommendation:** You should make **single-argument constructors** `explicit` by default.

**Why?** As we discussed, non-`explicit` single-argument constructors enable implicit type conversions which can lead to:
* **Surprise:** Code does things you didn't expect (like creating temporary objects).
* **Hidden Costs:** Performance overhead from unnoticed object creation/destruction.
* **Ambiguity:** Compiler might choose a conversion you didn't intend if multiple exist.
* **Reduced Readability:** Harder to see exactly what types are being used and when objects are constructed.

Making them `explicit` forces you (and others reading the code) to be clear about object creation: `MyClass obj(value);` instead of relying on the compiler to potentially do it silently via `MyClass obj = value;` or function calls like `func(value);` where `func` expects a `MyClass`.

**Important Exceptions (When *NOT* to use `explicit`):**

1.  **Copy Constructors and Move Constructors:**
    * `MyClass(const MyClass& other);` (Copy)
    * `MyClass(MyClass&& other);` (Move)
    * These are technically single-argument constructors, but they **must not** be marked `explicit`. The core mechanics of C++ rely on these being non-explicit for things like passing/returning objects by value and initialization (`MyClass obj = other_obj;`). Making them `explicit` would break fundamental language features and prevent your class from behaving normally in many situations. The compiler knows not to use these for converting *from other types* anyway.

2.  **Deliberate Implicit Conversion (Use with Caution):**
    * Sometimes, you might *want* your class to seamlessly convert from another type because it strongly represents or wraps that type. A classic example might be a lightweight `StringRef` class designed to be easily constructed from `const char*` or `std::string` without explicit calls everywhere.
    * **If:**
        * The conversion is intuitive and obvious (e.g., creating a string reference from a string literal).
        * The construction is cheap (doesn't do lots of work).
        * The class truly acts as a *proxy* or *wrapper* for the source type.
        * You understand the potential downsides and decide the usability benefits outweigh them.
    * **Then:** You *might* choose to omit `explicit`. However, this should be a conscious design decision, not the default.

**So, the refined rule is:** Always mark single-argument constructors `explicit`, *except* for copy/move constructors, and *unless* you are making a deliberate, well-considered design choice to allow implicit conversion for specific usability reasons (often for simple, value-like wrapper types).

**2. Why is *single argument* a problem?**

The focus is on single-argument constructors because they provide a clear, unambiguous rule for the compiler to perform an **implicit conversion from one type to another.**

* **Implicit Conversion Needs One Source:** When the compiler sees code that requires an object of `MyClass` but finds a value of `SomeType`, it looks for a way to convert `SomeType` *into* `MyClass`.
* **Single-Argument Constructor = Direct Recipe:** A constructor like `MyClass(SomeType value)` provides a perfect, direct recipe: "Take exactly one `SomeType` value and use it to produce a `MyClass` object." The compiler can apply this recipe automatically (implicitly) when needed if it's not marked `explicit`.
* **Multiple Arguments = No Clear Implicit Path:** If a constructor takes multiple arguments, like `MyClass(int a, double b)`, and the compiler only has a single `int` value, how would it know what `double b` to use for an implicit conversion? It can't guess the missing arguments. Therefore, constructors requiring more than one argument cannot be used for implicit conversions from a single source value.
* **Zero Arguments (Default Constructor):** `MyClass()` creates an object from *nothing*, so it can't be used to convert *from* another type.
* **Nuance: Default Arguments:** What about `MyClass(int a, double b = 0.0)`? This constructor *can be called* with a single argument (`MyClass(10)`). Because it *can* be invoked with just one argument, it **can** also be used for implicit conversion from `int` if it's not marked `explicit`. So, the rule really applies to constructors *callable* with a single argument.

**In summary:** The "problem" is specific to constructors **callable with a single argument** because only they provide the straightforward `SourceType -> TargetClass` mapping that the compiler uses for implicit type conversions. `explicit` gives you control over whether that automatic mapping is allowed. Multi-argument constructors don't present the same implicit conversion pathway from a single value.
