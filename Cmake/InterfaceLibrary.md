Sure! Let's break down **CMake interface libraries** in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

### 🔧 What Is a CMake Interface Library?

An **interface library** in CMake is like a *virtual* or *header-only* library. It **doesn’t compile into a real `.lib` or `.a` file**, but instead acts as a **container for properties** (like include directories, compile definitions, etc.) that other targets can use.

---

### 🤝 Why Use an Interface Library?

Imagine you have some header-only utility code — no `.cpp` files, just `.h` files — and you want other parts of your project to be able to include and use it.

Rather than creating a full library, you can define an **interface library** that:

* Exposes the headers via `target_include_directories`
* Shares compile definitions or options
* Helps organize and modularize your project

---

### 🧱 Simple Example

Let’s say you have this structure:

```
my_project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── my_utils/
    ├── include/
    │   └── my_utils.hpp
```

You can declare an interface library like this:

```cmake
add_library(my_utils INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(my_utils INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/my_utils/include)
```

Then, in another part of your project, you link it like this:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE my_utils)
```

Even though `my_utils` doesn’t have any compiled code, it provides include paths to the compiler — like saying “Hey compiler, here’s where you can find the header files.”

### ⚠️ Key Points to Remember

| Concept                   | Explanation                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `INTERFACE` library       | Only passes along properties (no compilation, no linking).               |
| Use case                  | Header-only libraries, compile-time settings, organizing dependencies.   |
| No source files           | It can’t have `.cpp` files — it’s not compiled.                          |
| Propagation of properties | Properties (includes, defines, etc.) are used by anything that links it. |

### 🔍 When to Use It

* You’re using a header-only library.
* You want to group and reuse compiler flags or include paths.
* You want to abstract away some build settings for consumers.
