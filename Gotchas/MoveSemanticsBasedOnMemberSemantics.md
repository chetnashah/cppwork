Okay, let's break down how the copy and move semantics of a class's member variables influence the copy and move semantics of the class itself in C++.

The key principle is how the compiler **implicitly generates** the special member functions for your class:

1.  **Copy Constructor:** `ClassName(const ClassName& other)`
2.  **Copy Assignment Operator:** `ClassName& operator=(const ClassName& other)`
3.  **Move Constructor:** `ClassName(ClassName&& other) noexcept` (ideally)
4.  **Move Assignment Operator:** `ClassName& operator=(ClassName&& other) noexcept` (ideally)

The compiler's ability to generate these, and what those generated functions *do*, depends directly on the capabilities of the class's non-static data members (and base classes, if any).

**General Rules for Implicit Generation:**

*   **Copy Operations:** The compiler will implicitly generate a copy constructor and copy assignment operator *if* you haven't declared any yourself, *and* if **all** non-static members and base classes are copyable. If any member or base is *not* copyable (e.g., it's move-only or non-copyable/non-movable), the compiler will implicitly **delete** the corresponding copy operation for your class. The implicitly generated copy operations perform member-wise copying.
*   **Move Operations:** The compiler will implicitly generate a move constructor and move assignment operator *if*:
    *   You have not declared any copy operations (constructor/assignment), move operations (constructor/assignment), or a destructor yourself. (Declaring *any* of these often suppresses implicit generation of move operations).
    *   **All** non-static members and base classes are movable (either they have move operations or are trivially movable).
    *   If any member or base is *not* movable (e.g., copy-only, non-copyable/non-movable), the compiler will *not* implicitly generate move operations for your class.
    *   The implicitly generated move operations perform member-wise moving.
*   **Deletion:** If the conditions for generation aren't met because a member lacks the required capability (e.g., trying to generate a copy constructor when a member is move-only), the compiler implicitly defines that special member function as `= delete`.

Now let's consider the 4 kinds of member variables within a class `MyClass`:

---

**Case 1: Member is Copyable + Movable (e.g., `int`, `std::string`, `std::vector<T>`)**

*   **Class Copy Semantics:**
    *   The compiler **can** implicitly generate the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
    *   These generated functions will invoke the *copy* operations of the member variable.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **copyable** by default.
*   **Class Move Semantics:**
    *   The compiler **can** implicitly generate the move constructor and move assignment operator (assuming no user-declared copy/move/destructor interferes).
    *   These generated functions will invoke the *move* operations of the member variable.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **movable** by default.

**Conclusion:** If all members are copyable and movable, the class itself will be copyable and movable by default, using the respective operations of its members.

---

**Case 2: Member is Movable Only (e.g., `std::unique_ptr<T>`, `std::thread`, `std::fstream`)**

*   **Class Copy Semantics:**
    *   The member is *not* copyable.
    *   The compiler **cannot** implicitly generate copy operations for `MyClass`. They will be implicitly **deleted**.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **non-copyable** by default. Trying to copy it will result in a compile-time error.
*   **Class Move Semantics:**
    *   The member *is* movable.
    *   The compiler **can** implicitly generate the move constructor and move assignment operator (assuming no user-declared copy/move/destructor interferes).
    *   These generated functions will invoke the *move* operations of the member variable.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **movable** by default.

**Conclusion:** If a class contains *any* move-only member (and no non-copyable/non-movable members), the class itself will become move-only by default.

---

**Case 3: Member is Copyable Only (Rare, maybe a legacy type or a type deliberately lacking move operations)**

*   **Class Copy Semantics:**
    *   The member *is* copyable.
    *   The compiler **can** implicitly generate the copy constructor and copy assignment operator.
    *   These generated functions will invoke the *copy* operations of the member variable.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **copyable** by default.
*   **Class Move Semantics:**
    *   The member is *not* movable (lacks move operations).
    *   The compiler **cannot** implicitly generate move operations for `MyClass` that perform actual moves on this member.
    *   *However*, if a move is requested (e.g., `MyClass b = std::move(a);`) and the class *is* copyable, the compiler will typically fall back to using the **copy constructor** or **copy assignment operator** for the class, which in turn will *copy* the copy-only member.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **copyable** by default. It will *not* have implicitly generated *move* operations. Attempts to "move" it will likely result in a copy if copy operations are available.

**Conclusion:** If a class contains a copy-only member (and all other members are at least copyable), the class will be copyable. It won't gain implicit move semantics; moves will likely degrade to copies.

---

**Case 4: Member is Non-Movable + Non-Copyable (e.g., `std::mutex`, `std::atomic<T>`, `const` members, reference members)**

*   **Class Copy Semantics:**
    *   The member is *not* copyable.
    *   The compiler **cannot** implicitly generate copy operations for `MyClass`. They will be implicitly **deleted**.
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **non-copyable** by default.
*   **Class Move Semantics:**
    *   The member is *not* movable.
    *   The compiler **cannot** implicitly generate move operations for `MyClass`. They will be implicitly **deleted** (or simply not generated).
    *   **Result:** `MyClass` will be **non-movable** by default.

**Conclusion:** If a class contains *any* non-copyable, non-movable member, the class itself becomes non-copyable and non-movable by default.

**Summary Table (Default Behavior)**

| Member Type                  | Class Default Copyable? | Class Default Movable? | Notes                                                                 |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Copyable + Movable           | Yes                     | Yes                    | Uses member copy/move.                                                |
| Movable Only                 | **No** (Deleted)        | Yes                    | Class becomes move-only.                                              |
| Copyable Only                | Yes                     | **No** (Uses Copy)     | Class is copyable. Move requests typically fall back to using copy. |
| Non-Movable + Non-Copyable | **No** (Deleted)        | **No** (Deleted)       | Class becomes non-copyable and non-movable.                           |

**Important Considerations:**

1.  **User-Defined Operations:** If you explicitly declare *any* of the five special member functions (copy/move constructors, copy/move assignment, destructor), the rules for implicit generation change, especially for move operations. Defining even just a destructor prevents the implicit generation of move operations.
2.  **`= default`:** You can explicitly ask the compiler to generate a special member function using `= default`. The compiler will attempt to do so following the rules above (checking member capabilities). If a member prevents generation, using `= default` will result in that function being defined as deleted or a compile error.
3.  **`= delete`:** You can explicitly forbid a special member function using `= delete`, regardless of member capabilities.
4.  **Manual Implementation:** If you write your own special member functions, you are responsible for correctly copying or moving each member according to its capabilities. You *could*, for example, make a class containing a `unique_ptr` copyable by manually creating a deep copy of the pointed-to resource in your copy constructor, but the compiler won't do this for you automatically.

In essence, the capabilities of the members set the "least common denominator" for the default capabilities of the class. A single non-copyable member makes the class non-copyable by default; a single non-movable member makes the class non-movable by default.
