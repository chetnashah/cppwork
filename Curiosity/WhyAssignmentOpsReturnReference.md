Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Constructors (Copy/Move): Purpose is Initialization**
    * Constructors are special functions called only when a **new object is being created**.
    * Their job is to **initialize the memory** for that new object, often using another object as a source (for copy/move constructors).
    * They don't *return* a value in the traditional sense; their "result" *is* the newly created and initialized object itself.
    * Therefore, constructors **do not have a declared return type**, not even `void`.

2.  **Assignment Operators (Copy/Move): Purpose is Modification (of "this" which is returned)**
    * Assignment operators (`operator=`) are called on an **already existing object** (the one on the left side of the `=`).
    * Their job is to **modify the state** of this existing object, typically by discarding its old state and replacing it with a state copied or moved from the object on the right side.
    * Since they operate on an existing object and are regular (though specially named) functions, they *can* and *do* have a return value.

**Why Return `T&` (Reference to Self) for Assignment Operators?**

The convention of returning `T&` (specifically, returning `*this`) from copy and move assignment operators exists primarily for one reason:

* **To Enable Assignment Chaining:** C++ allows chaining assignments like this:
    ```c++
    MyClass obj1, obj2, obj3;
    // ... initialize obj3 ...
    obj1 = obj2 = obj3; // Chain assignment
    ```
    This statement is evaluated right-to-left: `obj1 = (obj2 = obj3);`
    * First, `obj2 = obj3` is executed. `obj2.operator=(obj3)` is called. This function modifies `obj2`.
    * For the *result* of `(obj2 = obj3)` to be assignable to `obj1`, the `operator=` must return something representing the now-modified `obj2`.
    * Returning a reference to `obj2` itself (`*this` from within `obj2`'s `operator=`) achieves this perfectly. The expression `(obj2 = obj3)` effectively yields `obj2` (as an lvalue reference).
    * Then, `obj1 = obj2` is executed by calling `obj1.operator=(obj2)`.

* **Consistency with Built-in Types:** This chaining behavior mirrors how assignment works for built-in types like `int`, `float`, etc. Returning `T&` makes user-defined classes behave consistently.

* **Efficiency:** Returning a reference avoids making an unnecessary temporary copy of the object after the assignment is complete.

**Why not return `T` (by value) or `void`?**

* Returning `T` by value would work for chaining but would involve creating a potentially expensive temporary copy.
* Returning `void` would completely disallow assignment chaining, breaking a common C++ idiom.

**Example Implementation:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <utility> // For std::move

class MyClass {
public:
    int value;

    MyClass(int v = 0) : value(v) {}

    // Copy Constructor (no return type)
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) : value(other.value) {
        std::cout << "Copy constructor called\n";
    }

    // Move Constructor (no return type)
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) noexcept : value(other.value) {
        other.value = 0; // Leave the source in a valid state
        std::cout << "Move constructor called\n";
    }

    // Copy Assignment Operator (returns MyClass&)
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        std::cout << "Copy assignment operator called\n";
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            value = other.value;
        }
        return *this; // Return reference to the modified object
    }

    // Move Assignment Operator (returns MyClass&)
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) noexcept {
         std::cout << "Move assignment operator called\n";
        if (this != &other) { // Protect against self-assignment
            value = other.value;
            other.value = 0; // Leave the source in a valid state
        }
        return *this; // Return reference to the modified object
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass a(10);
    MyClass b(20);
    MyClass c(30);

    std::cout << "--- Chaining Assignment ---\n";
    a = b = c; // Calls c.operator= for b, then b.operator= for a
               // Possible if operator= returns MyClass&

    std::cout << "a.value: " << a.value << std::endl; // Output: 30
    std::cout << "b.value: " << b.value << std::endl; // Output: 30
    std::cout << "c.value: " << c.value << std::endl; // Output: 30

    return 0;
}
```

In short: Constructors *create*, so they don't return. Assignment operators *modify* an existing object and return a reference (`T&`) to it primarily to allow the natural chaining syntax (`a = b = c;`) common in C++.
